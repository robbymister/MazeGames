# MazeGames
Python MazeGames that I made. Different variations are here such as single and 2-player versions. The drillbot uses recursions to drill around a map and detect the best path to collect all the gems. Once it traverses the whole map it returns to its starting position and tallies up everything it collected. The MazeFight game is a variation of the 1-player game with some simple text-based fight mechanics when landing on a certain tile
